Today's Workshop you need to complete a few functions:
In the Utilities module complete:

-Initialise_Robot_arm
-move_arm_deg
-move_arm_rad

In the Kinematics Module Complete:
-ForwardKinematics
Fill in the DH parameters

*You'll need to read the Kinematics document in internet 
Chromium to understand what to fill in ForwardKinematics
Otherwise, just ask and I'll be happy to explain.

After that you can control the arm to go to any 
motor angle you like just for fun in Robot_script.py
